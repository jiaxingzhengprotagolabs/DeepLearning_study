    "Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first (required) programming assignment! You will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats. This assignment will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.\n",
